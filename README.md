# vscode-snippets

Useful snippets for faster, more reliable script editing with VSCode. If you already have custom VSCode snippets then copy all or any of the snippets here and paste them directly into your own Powershell.json.

If you haven't started using VSCode snippets yet then access them via the **File** menu, **Preferences**, **User Snippets** option.

## So far we have snippets for

[Pester](https://github.com/fatherjack/vscode-snippets/blob/master/pester.json)

Pester is a module within PowerShell but for ease of locating Pester specific snippets they are in a separate file. The Pester snippet prefixes start with "_p" so they are listed all together in the intellisense list.
