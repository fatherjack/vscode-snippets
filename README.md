# vscode-snippets

Useful snippets for faster, more reliable script editing with VSCode. If you already have custom VSCode snippets then copy all or any of the snippets here and paste them directly into your own Powershell.json.

If you haven't started using VSCode snippets yet then access them via the **File** menu, **Preferences**, **User Snippets** option.
